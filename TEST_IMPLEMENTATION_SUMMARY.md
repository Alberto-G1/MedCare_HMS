## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
cd medcare_hms
python manage.py test

# Run with parallel processing (faster)
python manage.py test --parallel

# Run specific module
python manage.py test chat
python manage.py test notifications
python manage.py test billing
```

### Using Test Runners
```bash
# Python script (cross-platform)
python run_tests.py

# PowerShell script (Windows)
.\run_tests.ps1
```

### With Coverage
```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Creates htmlcov/index.html
```

## 📚 Testing Best Practices Implemented

1. **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Clear test structure
   - Easy to understand and maintain

2. **Descriptive Test Names**
   - Each test clearly states what it tests
   - Docstrings provide additional context

3. **setUp() Methods**
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Consistent test data

4. **Helper Functions**
   - `create_user_with_role()` for user creation
   - Reusable across test modules

5. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test is independent
   - Can run in any order

6. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Models, views, utilities
   - Integration tests
   - Edge cases

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
3. Aim for >80% code coverage
4. Follow existing test patterns
5. Update TESTING.md with new patterns

---

## 📝 Example Usage

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Test a specific feature you're working on
python manage.py test chat.tests.ChatModelTest.test_thread_creation

# Test entire module during development
python manage.py test notifications --keepdb

# Quick parallel test before commit
python manage.py test --parallel --failfast
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Keep database for inspection
python manage.py test --keepdb --verbosity=2

# Run only failed tests (Django 4.1+)
python manage.py test --failed

# Stop on first failure
python manage.py test --failfast
```
